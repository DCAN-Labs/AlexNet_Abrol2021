# Loes Scoring using Deep Learning

* The Loes score is an adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) MRI score, which rates the severity of white matter lesions and ranges from 0 (normal) â€“ 34 (abnormal)

---

# Clinician computation
* 34 parts of the brain are examined
* Each part is given a score of either 0 (no white matter lesions) or 1 (white matter lesions present)
* Individual scores are summed

# AlexNet
* Convolutional neural network architecture that won the 2012 ImageNet ILSVRC challenge
* Developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton
* First architecture to stack convolutional layers directly on top of one another, instead of stacking a pooling layer on top of each convolutional layer

# AlexNet (continued)
![width:800px height:350px](Comparison_image_neural_networks.svg.png)
* Our implementation is 3-D, rather than 2-D
* We use regression in the last layer to output real number between 0 and 34

---

# Two approaches
* Top-down: one model taking whole-brain MRI as input and giving output number between 0 and 34
* Bottom-up: 34 models (possibly only 17 up to symmetry) each taking segment of brain as input and 0 or 1 as output
* We're hoping the top-down works, if only for simplicity.  There are arguments for and against the bottom-up approach
